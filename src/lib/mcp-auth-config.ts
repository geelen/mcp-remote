/**
 * MCP Remote Authentication Configuration
 *
 * This module handles the storage and retrieval of authentication-related data for MCP Remote.
 *
 * Configuration directory structure:
 * - The config directory is determined by MCP_REMOTE_CONFIG_DIR env var or defaults to ~/.mcp-auth,
 *   with a subdirectory naming the store layout - stable across releases, see CONFIG_STORE_VERSION
 * - Each file is prefixed with a hash of the server URL to separate configurations for different servers
 *
 * Files stored in the config directory:
 * - {server_hash}_client_info.json: Contains OAuth client registration information
 *   - Format: OAuthClientInformation object with client_id and other registration details
 * - {server_hash}_tokens.json: Contains OAuth access and refresh tokens
 *   - Format: OAuthTokens object with access_token, refresh_token, and expiration information
 * - {server_hash}_code_verifier_{state}.txt: Contains the PKCE code verifier for one OAuth flow
 *   - Format: Plain text string used for PKCE verification
 *   - Scoped to the flow's authorization state rather than to a process, so whichever instance
 *     holds the callback port when the user finishes can redeem a code from a flow another
 *     instance started - including one the host has since stopped (see issue #235)
 *
 * All JSON files are stored with 2-space indentation for readability.
 */

/**
 * The layout of the stored credentials, not the version of this package.
 *
 * Raise it by hand, and only when something already on disk would be misread by the code reading
 * it - a renamed file, a changed shape, a credential that has to be reissued. Everyone's stored
 * sign-ins are discarded when it changes, so that is the whole point of it and also the reason it
 * should almost never move.
 *
 * It used to be the package version, which meant every release discarded them: a token store is
 * keyed by this directory, so a new version always found an empty one and every server asked the
 * user to sign in again. At ten releases in three days, that was a sign-in per release per server
 * (see https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote/issues/200).
